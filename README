Scripts for "online" analysis of e-cloud MD data. The idea is that data can be copied to a USB drive as it is taken; the data files will be automatically synced to a local directory, and some basic plots will be made, whenever the drive is connected.

The online analysis is built around two scripts that are to be run continuously.

One (either online_process.sh or copy_data.m - the former will only run on a Unix shell; the latter should be platform-independent but requires that it be run in parallel with the other Matlab script) watches for .wfm files in a "source" directory. If it sees any new files, these are copied to a local "temp" directory. Once the files are copied, the USB drive can be unmounted.

The other is watch_data.m; this monitors the "temp" directory for new data. Delta channel data is filtered and equalized; spectrograms and waveforms are displayed and saved to PNG files in the "plots" directory. Once the analysis is done, the files are moved to the "data" directory.
